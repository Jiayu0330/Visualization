<h1>Good Visualization Example</h1>
<p> According to Cairo’s “the five qualities of great visualizations”, a good visualization should be truthful, functional, beautiful, 
insightful and enlightening. This example I found online is about 10 language families that that are spoken by at least 1% of world 
population. First, this one is truthful, because there is the resource of the data on the uppermost of the graphic- “DataSet referred 
to 2013, acquired from ethnologue.com”. Second, it is functional because people can click the buttons below to select the language 
they want to see, and the small colorful dots will show on the map. In other words, people can interact with the webpage well. Third, 
it is beautiful. The background color makes sure that the text can be easily seen, and the design is very simple and comfortable. Then, 
it is insightful to show the data in this way, which directly shows people how the languages distribute in the world. Finally, it is 
enlightening since people can easily understand the goal of this graph and the purpose of the author after seeing the graph. Also, they 
will have a deeper understanding to this topic.</p>

<h1>Bad Visualization Example</h1>
<p> This visualization is a poor one because there is no research resource to make people believe the authenticity. For this graph, 
  although the audience can get the main idea of the author, they can’t get more information from the graph. More importantly, this 
  distribution graph looks too simply and can’t attract people from keeping attention to the details. People will feel boring and forget 
  the data very soon, because the author didn’t interpret the data and show the audience in a funny way.</p>
